Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to somethin', they just not just bluffin'
You don't have to call, I hit my dance like Usher, woo
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ Mustard, woo
I hit that Ginóbili with my left hand up like woo
Lobster and Céline for all my babies that I miss
Chicken fingers, french fries for them hoes that wanna diss
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
Uh, uh, uh, I think I need some Robitussin
Way too many questions, you must think I trust ya
You searchin' for answers, I do not know nothing, woo
I see 'em tweakin', they know something's comin', woo
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin', woo
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, fuck was you expecting? Woo
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Michael Jordan just had text me, woo
